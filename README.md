First file is an NBA desktop application to keep track of NBA teams and data.  Program reads and writes information from a text file.  A user can serach for an NBA team and view its data.  If a team has not been entered in the NBA application, a user can add it to the data file.  The program was written in java code and used encapsulation, OOP concepts, array lists, and file I/O processing. 


Second file I am currently creating a java desktop baseball application that helps keep track of tournaments, players, and cost per season.  So far the app uses OOP concepts like aggregation and encapsulation.  App also uses ArrayLists and objects and will eventually have a GUI to make is more user friendly.
